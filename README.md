# ReactJS CRUD Books

This project will help you learn and understand simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Ajax. We use the Axios package for managing Ajax requests.

With this package, you can create a book list, edit the titles of the books, and delete them. Additionally, each book will be assigned a new random picture.

## Setup Project
#### 1) Navigate to the folder where you want to set up the project.
#### 2) Open the command line:
```
git clone git@github.com:JigishS/reactjs-crud-books.git
```
#### 3) Go to the project folder:
```
cd reactjs-crud-books
```
#### 3) Install the required packages:
```
npm install
```
#### 4) Now you are ready to start and explore the project:
```
npm start
```
#### 5) Open a new terminal and start the following command to manage the JSON server. This server will handle the storage of your data:
```
npm run server
```
#### 5) For obtaining the book images, we are using the <a href="https://picsum.photos">picsum.photos</a> website, which provides random photos.
#### 6) You can modify the image size in the `src/components/BookShow.js` file. Look for the image tag with the URL and size, and adjust it according to your requirements.
#### 7) Bonus tip for VS Code users: We have included an `api.http` file, which can be useful for checking API requests and responses within VS Code.
* To use it, install the "REST Client" extension by "Huachao Mao" in VS Code.
* Open the api.http file, and you'll see a 'Send Request' button above each request.
* Clicking the button will open the output window with the response details.
* You can modify the data and requests in the file to test different scenarios.

Feel free to explore and enjoy learning with the ReactJS CRUD Books project!
